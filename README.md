#Toolbox :

This toolbox provides useful sample projects.

My "Toolbox" projects will be a series of projects designed to do common things in a number of different ways, from the complex to the trivial. They could be used as skeletons to start working on your own code, or by comparing different versions to understand what needs to be done to do things in a better way. They might also be useful as test stubs.

# toolbox-trivial-java-auth-client

A simple application that uses an auth microservice


This is just an example of how to use Auth in Spring this uses a trivial auth service. 

This version provides rest APIs as well as traditional Sring MVC web application pages using thymeleaf. 

The Authentication is tied to the spring session. 

If you want just a REST API project then that would normally involve Bearer Tokens.
